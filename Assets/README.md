I mainly wanted an excuse to use the Dalek model I made, but I turned this into an asthetic feel.
I wanted to capture the raw power of a Delek, nothing can harm you, everthing fears you.
To this end I have humaniod targets that go down with one shot, closed doors can be shot open, and even the
auto-turrets have no effect on you.
The main point of the turrets is to actually showcase the daleks shielded might. I set up the bullets so that
when they would hit the dalek, they are not destroyed but uses the physics engine to deflet them off of the shields.
The player feels powerful as they see a stream a bullets just bouncing off of them.

Given more time I could have made a shader to create a shield look
but I think that the trail renderers along give the same effect.

I went with the ADM style. As stated above I wanted to give the player the raw power of a Dalek, to make them
feel nearly invincible. There is no health system in place for the player currently, a deliberate choice to keep with
the inital feel. On the flip side of this the players weapon is not rapid fire, I wanted to portray it as a slow, deliberate, and
powerful weapon.
